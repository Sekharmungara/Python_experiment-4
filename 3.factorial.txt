** Write a python program  to find factorial values 1 to 10 using function? **


def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else :
        return n* factorial(n-1)
for i in range (1,11):
    result = factorial(i)
    print("factorial of ",i,"is",result)

input & output:

factorial of  1 is 1
factorial of  2 is 2
factorial of  3 is 6
factorial of  4 is 24
factorial of  5 is 120
factorial of  6 is 720

factorial of  7 is 5040

factorial of  8 is 40320

factorial of  9 is 362880

factorial of  10 is 3628800
